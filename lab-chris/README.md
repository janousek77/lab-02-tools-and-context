## Description
401 JS -- Class 02 tools and context lab

Started off by taking the code from the demo done by Duncan and pasting it in. Added a simple test which took a little bit to get right but passed. Added a conditional and refactored. Since most of the tools were the same I copied and pasted five and altered what I needed too. Getting the tests right for each took the longest time. All the tools pass. Started working on the CLI portion. I became confused thinking I had to pass the array and function in terminal before finally being told that only the array needed to be passed as an argument in the terminal. After that it took two minutes to get passing. Not sure if the linter is broken still or not.
